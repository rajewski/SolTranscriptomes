Proceeding with single-core trimming (user-defined)
Path to Cutadapt set as: 'cutadapt' (default)
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')
Cutadapt version: 2.10
single-core operation.
No quality encoding type selected. Assuming that the data provided uses Sanger encoded Phred scores (default)



AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> SRR3199622_1.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Illumina	184	AGATCGGAAGAGC	1000000	0.02
smallRNA	2	TGGAATTCTCGG	1000000	0.00
Nextera	2	CTGTCTCTTATA	1000000	0.00
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 184). Second best hit was smallRNA (count: 2)


SUMMARISING RUN PARAMETERS
==========================
Input filename: SRR3199622_1.fastq.gz
Trimming mode: single-end
Trim Galore version: 0.6.4_dev
Cutadapt version: 2.10
Number of cores used for trimming: 1
Quality Phred score cutoff: 20
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' (Illumina TruSeq, Sanger iPCR; auto-detected)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length before a sequence gets removed: 20 bp
Output file(s) will be GZIP compressed

Cutadapt seems to be fairly up-to-date (version 2.10). Setting -j 1
Writing final adapter and quality trimmed output to SRR3199622_1_trimmed.fq.gz
