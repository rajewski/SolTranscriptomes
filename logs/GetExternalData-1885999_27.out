Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')


AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> ERR2809805_1.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
smallRNA	1	TGGAATTCTCGG	1000000	0.00
Nextera	1	CTGTCTCTTATA	1000000	0.00
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	1000000	0.00
Unable to auto-detect most prominent adapter from the first specified file (count smallRNA: 1, count Nextera: 1)
Using smallRNA adapter for trimming (count: 1). Second best hit was Nextera (count: 1)

Reducing length cutoff to 18bp for small RNA-Seq reads because a cutoff of 20bp may remove some short species of small RNAs if they had been trimmed by 1,2 or 3bp
