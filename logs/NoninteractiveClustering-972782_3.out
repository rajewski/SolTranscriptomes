Normalizing counts
Done.
Now for some diagnostic plots:
Filtering DEGs to FDR threshold less than 0.01
11427 genes remaining
Using all 11427 DEGs. Maybe consider fewer to speed clustering?
Two entries detected for Genotype. Plots will be colored by Genotype
A large number of genes was given-- please, make sure this is not an error. Normally, only DE genes will be useful for this function.
Working with 11427 genes.
Working with 9821 genes after filtering: minc > 15
